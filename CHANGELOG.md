# Changelog

[`sh1106`](https://crates.io/crates/sh1106) is a Rust driver for the SH1106 OLED display. It
supports [embedded-graphics](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-graphics) or raw pixel drawing modes
and works with the [embedded-hal](crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) traits for maximum portability.
